<p>Global warming is the long-term rise in Earth's average temperature, primarily driven by human activities that release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes are the main culprits, trapping heat and disrupting the climate. The consequences include more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and a significant threat to ecosystems and human well-being. Addressing this crisis requires urgent action, such as transitioning to renewable energy and adopting sustainable practices.  
Causes: Human activities like burning fossil fuels for energy and transportation, and cutting down forests, release excess greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise. 
Effects: The rise in global temperature is leading to more extreme weather, like hurricanes and heatwaves, melting glaciers, and rising sea levels. These changes threaten ecosystems, biodiversity, and human health, impacting agriculture and causing widespread environmental disruption.
